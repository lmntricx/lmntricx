#Question
Absolute path:

#Answer
An absolute path specifies the full directory hierarchy from the root directory to the target file or directory. It always starts from the root directory (/). For example, /home/user/documents/file.txt is an absolute path to a file named "file.txt" located in the "documents" directory within the "user" directory of the root directory.
