Use of tab completion:

#Answer
Tab completion is a feature in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to quickly and efficiently type commands, file names, and directory names by pressing the "Tab" key. When typing a command or file/directory name, pressing "Tab" will automatically complete the input if there is only one possible option, or present a list of possible options for selection if there are multiple matches. This enhances productivity by reducing typing and minimizing errors.
